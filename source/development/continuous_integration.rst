Continuous Integration for Pyicub
=================================

This document outlines the Continuous Integration (CI) strategy and setup for the ``pyicub`` project. It details the process by which automated tests are executed in a Dockerized simulation environment. **Due to YARP's limitations with GitHub Actions, this CI workflow is executed locally using Docker and Git hooks instead of GitHub Actions.**

Goals of CI
-----------

The CI system is designed to:

- Automatically run the full simulation stack for the iCub robot in a headless Docker environment.
- Execute all Python-based integration tests using ``pytest``.
- Detect regressions early during development, before code is pushed to the remote repository.
- Provide fast feedback to developers while preserving realistic robot middleware behavior (YARP).
- Collect and archive test results for debugging and reproducibility.

Key Design Decisions
--------------------

- **Avoid GitHub Actions**: YARP relies on low-level networking and requires port-based communication that conflicts with GitHub Action’s restricted container networking (e.g., no ``--network host`` support).
- **Run Tests Locally**: Instead, tests are executed locally in Docker via a ``pre-push`` Git hook.
- **Full Stack Testing**: The CI setup emulates the real robot middleware environment with YARP, Gazebo, and ``yarprobotinterface``, validating the full software stack.

Infrastructure Overview
------------------------

- **Containerization**: Docker Compose (using profiles and environment overrides)
- **Simulation Engine**: Gazebo Classic in headless mode
- **Robot Middleware**: YARP + yarprobotinterface + iKinGazeCtrl
- **Test Framework**: Pytest (with optional coverage plugin)
- **Artifacts**: Test result XML or HTML saved in ``docker/results/``

``runTests.sh`` — Test Execution Pipeline
-----------------------------------------

This Bash script is the core of the CI logic. It is executed inside the ``pyicub-test`` container.

**Responsibilities:**

- Launch ``yarpserver`` and ``yarprun``
- Start ``gzserver`` in headless mode with the iCub world
- Start ``yarprobotinterface`` for hardware abstraction
- Launch ``iKinGazeCtrl`` for head control
- Run ``pytest`` to validate the Python interface

**Robustness Features:**

- Tracks and manages PIDs for all launched components
- Monitors readiness of the simulation environment
- Handles timeouts and prints useful error messages



CI Success Criteria
-------------------

CI is considered successful when:

- All Docker containers build correctly.
- The ``pytest`` suite executes without error.
- Simulation starts cleanly and robot interface is responsive.
- Test results are saved in ``/workspace/pyicub/``.
